JelloSwift
==========

Soft-body physics dynamics library written in Swift
----------

Video demo available here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0J6P5WaxSHA

This is a port of JelloPhysics, a C#/C++ soft-body physics engine (the original license is included at the JelloPhysics-License.md file).

This port more closely resembles the AS3 version of the engine, [JelloAS3](http://sourceforge.net/projects/jelloas3/), with many optimizations and modifications made to better fit Swift, with the biggest change being how spring and pressure bodies are defined.

The project comes with a demo scene for the iPad, so just fire up and drag the soft bodies around!
